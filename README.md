# Capstone-Project 📽️
🏹 Objectives:
− Research, develop, and build a program for detecting the target to be welded, estimating the welding position.
− Study the design of a lead soldering delivery system for electronic component soldering operations.
− Research and develop algorithms for controlling an automated welding robot for predefined targets.
− Construct a user-friendly interactive interface to serve educational and research purposes.

🔭 Scope:
− Objects: Electronic components used for insertion, such as: fences, plug resistors, plug capacitors, LED lights, integrated circuits, transistors.
− Layout: Electronic components are arranged on a PCB soldering test board within the defined working area.
− 🤖: Yaskawa Motomini, using YRC1000micro controller.
− 📷: ELECOM UCAM-C750FBBK.

Skills: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics, C++, Qt
